# Northcoders Student Tracker

Northcoders Student Tracker is a front-end interface for the administrator in Northcoders to keep track of their student records.
Data is fetched using a RESTful API. It is coded using React.js, axios and @reach/router.

This is one of the sprints I have done as a student in Northcoders bootcamp, which was completed in a day.
